Python is a great language. It is mature, it's syntax is easy and has great community support. That is the reason why many new developers lean toward using it. 
But, people that have worked with large project in Python should have realized that lack of static checking or even type hints has always been a pain-point to debug coherently.
Though, many projects like MyPy, PyRight, etc. have tried to solve this issue, they haven't been able to solve every nooks and corners of type checking. 
If you come from TypeScript like me, you know that enforcing types on an already established language is a difficult task but not impossible.

If you work in Python ecosystem, you should have definitely heard of a company called [Astral](https://astral.sh/). It's the company behind two of the fastest growing 
Python tooling ecosystem, [Ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) an extremely fast linter for Python and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a Python package and project management 
tool, both written in RustðŸ¦€. I use these 2 tools extensively in all of my recent Python projects and I highly recommend them if you care about upping your DX.

The team behind Astral has recently delved into what they called their biggest investment in Python tooling ecosystem. Designing an extremely fast and modern Python type checker, which also would be written RustðŸ¦€.
The are calling it "Ty" (*shot form for "type"?*). At this point the tool is still under development(alpha) and is no where ready to be used in production. 
NeverthelessðŸ˜›(I can't hold my excitements), in this blog post, we'll be going over some of the basic functionalities provided by the Ty. There are various ways to [install Ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/README.md#installation), 
but I know you guys won't be hurdling those setups so I've prepared a [repo](https://github.com/codeforreal1/python-typechecking) for you to just clone and get started. Also, there's an official [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty) 
of Ty available, so make sure to install it as well. Finally, let's do some type checking in Python.

### Basic Types
#### String
<span>String is represented by `str`</span>
<div class="code">
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

greet("Code For Real")
```
</div>

#### Integer
<span>Integer is represented by `int`</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

add(1, 2)
```
</div>

#### Float
<span>Decimal is represented by `float`</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
def area_of_circle(radius: float) -> float:
    return 3.14159 * radius**2

area_of_circle(2)
```
</div>

#### Boolean
<span>Boolean is represented by `bool`</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
def is_even(n: int) -> bool:
    return n % 2 == 0

is_even(1)
```
</div>

#### Bytes
<span>Bytes is represented by `bytes`</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
def to_bytes(data: str) -> bytes:
    return data.encode("utf-8")

to_bytes("Code For Real")
```
</div>

#### Null
<span>Void or null value is represented by `None`</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
def log(message: str) -> None:
    print(message)

log("Critical")

```
</div>


#### Summary
| Description | Syntax |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| String | `str` |
| Integer | `int` |
| Float/Decimal | `float` |
| Boolean | `bool` |
| Bytes | `bytes` |
| Void/Null | `None` |


<div class="mt-10" />
### Collections
All of the above basic types are globally available for type annotation within the environment. But for these advanced types, we need to import types from `typing` module.

#### List/Array:
<span>Arrays are generic types which are represented as `List[T]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import List

def total(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(numbers)

total([1, 2, 3])
```
</div>


#### Dictionary:
<span>Dictionaries are generic types which are represented as `Dict[K, V]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Dict

def invert(d: Dict[str, int]) -> Dict[int, str]:
    return {v: k for k, v in d.items()}

invert({"one": 1, "two": 2})
```
</div>


#### Set:
<span>Sets are generic types which are represented as `Set[T]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Set, List

def unique(values: List[int]) -> Set[int]:
    return set(values)

unique([1, 2, 3, 1])
```
</div>


#### Tuple:
<span>Tuples are generic types which are represented as `Tuple[T1, T2, ...]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Tuple

def coordinates() -> Tuple[float, float, str]:
    return (27.7, 85.3, "North")

coordinates()
```
</div>


#### Iterable:
<span>Iterable are generic types which are represented as `Iterable[T]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Iterable

def reduce_to_sum(items: Iterable[str]) -> int:
    return sum((item if type(item).__name__ == "int" else 0) for item in items)

reduce_to_sum([1,2,3])
reduce_to_sum({"One":1, "Two":2})
```
</div>


#### Sequence:
<span>Sequence are generic types which are represented as `Sequence[T]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Sequence

def first_three(items: Sequence[int]) -> Sequence[int]:
    return items[:3]

first_three([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
</div>


#### Summary
| Description | Syntax |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| List | `List[T]` |
| Dictionary | `Dict[K, V]` |
| Set | `Set[T]` |
| Tuple | `Tuple[T1, T2, ...]` |
| Iterable | `Iterable[T]` |
| Sequence | `Sequence[T]` |

<div class="mt-10" />
### Other Types

#### Literal:
<span>Literal types accepts any one of the value of same type listed represented as `Literal[T]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Literal

def set_theme(theme: Literal["light", "dark"]) -> str:
    return f"Mode set to {theme}"

set_theme("light")
```
</div>

#### Union:
<span>Union types accepts any one of the types listed represented as `Union[T1, T2, ...]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Union

def stringify(x: Union[int, float, str]) -> str:
    return str(x)

stringify(1)
stringify(1.2)
stringify("1")
```
</div>

#### Optional:
<span>Optional types accepts either the annotated value or `None` represented as `Optional[T]`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Optional

def save_gender(gender: Optional[Literal["Male", "Female", "Others"]] = None):
    if gender is not None:
        # Save
        pass
    # Do nothing

print(save_gender("Male"))
print(save_gender())

```
</div>

#### TypedDict:
<span>If you come from TypeScript then TypedDict is similar to interfaces. You can specify list of fields that you expect and enforce the type.`.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import TypedDict

class User(TypedDict):
    id: int
    name: str


def greet_user(user: User) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {user['name']}!"

greet_user(User({"id": "123", "name": "Code For Real"}))
```
</div>

#### Self:
<span>Self is used to represent the type of class instance itself.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Self

class Counter:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.count = 0

    def increment(self) -> Self:
        self.count += 1
        return self


counter = Counter()
_counter = counter.increment()
print(_counter.count)
```
</div>

#### Final:
<span>Final is to represent constant value. But keep in mind, this is just a type hint. We can still change the value in runtime even if type-checker complains it.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Final

# Final
PI: Final[float] = 3.14
```
</div>

#### Any:
<span>Any is used to discard any type enforcement. It just means do anything you want, I give up. By default, this is the type enforced by the compiler.</span>
<div class="code mt-2">
```python
from typing import Any

def debug_output(data: Any) -> None:
    print("DEBUG:", data)

debug_output("hello")
debug_output(1)

# This is equivalent to above.
def debug_output(data) -> None:
    print("DEBUG:", data)

```
</div>

#### Summary
| Description | Syntax |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Literal | `Literal[T]` |
| Union | `Union[T1, T2, ...]` |
| Optional | `Optional[T]` |
| TypedDict | `TypedDict` |
| Self | `Self` |
| Final | `Final` |
| Any | `Any` |

That's it for this one folks. Since the tool is still in alpha stage, a lot of features are missing. But I'll make sure to cover new features as soon as they are available for public release.
